# OpenPrism
An Android library enabling apps designed for the Google Glass to run on standard Android devices. Acts as a compatibility-focused drop-in replacement for the Glass Explorer Edition SDK.

All functions that were originally in the Glass Explorer Edition SDK work the same in OpenPrism on the Glass Explorer Edition. Compatibility with regular Android devices is limited; currently, only card scrolling and layouts have been implemented.
